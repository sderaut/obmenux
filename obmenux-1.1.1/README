==========
obmenux 1.1.1
==========

obmenux is an Openbox menu editor, written in Python, based on obmenu. It allows editing menus
in an intuitive way.

REQUIREMENTS:

  python = 2.7, pygtk, python-glade

INSTALLATION:
	
  Type these commands in a shell:
  
  su
  <password>
  python2 setup.py install

  or:
  python2 minisetup.py install
  if you don't want the pipemenus

  run using:
  obmenux
  
  or if your openbox menu for a session isn't named menu.xml:
  obmenux .config/openbox/your-menu-name.xml
  
  The installation should allow continuing to use other versions of obmenu that are not named obmenux.
  (If it causes any interference with other versions, that would be an issue to report.)
  
CHANGELOG:

- version 1.1.1 Moves items between menus (or into or out of menus, including
  moving menus into or out of menus) (deprecated use with Python 2.3 to 2.6)

- version 1.0-2 Debian patches
    - enabled closing the help window by its "Close" button
    - enabled creating .config/openbox/menu.xml if it doesn't already exist.

- Automatically reconfigures Openbox when saving a file.

- Creates and modifies pipemenus. Pipemenus are a way of creating menus
  dynamically. For more info, visit [Openbox](http://openbox.org) documentation.

- Creates "link" menus, which are references to other menus by their IDs.
  That way you can reproduce a sub-menu in several places in a whole menu file.

- Lots of GUI enhancements.

- Multifile support (New, Open, Save, Save As)
