CHANGELOG:

- version 1.1.1 moving items between menus (or into or out of menus, including
  moving menus into or out of menus) (deprecated use with Python 2.3 to 2.6)

- version 1.0-2 Debian patches
    - enable closing the help window by its "Close" button
    - enable creating .config/openbox/menu.xml if it doesn't already exist.

- Automatically reconfigures Openbox

- Create and modify pipemenus. Pipemenus are a way of creating menus
  dynamically. For more info, visit Openbox documentation.

- The same with "link" menus, which are references to other menus by their IDs.
  That way you can reproduce a menu in several places of your file.

- Lots of GUI enhancements
