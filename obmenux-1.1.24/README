==========
obmenux 1.1.25
==========

obmenux is an Openbox menu editor, written in Python, based on obmenu.
It allows editing menus in an intuitive way.

REQUIREMENTS:

  Python = 2.7, pygtk, python-glade

INSTALLATION:
	
  Download and extract the folder for the version you want.
  
  Open that folder in a terminal.
   
  Type:
    sudo python2 setup.py install
    
  or, to install without installing the pipe menu commands:
    sudo python2 minisetup.py install
    
  That script will show you what it did. Then it should be installed if nothing
  has gone wrong.

USE:
  
  Run it using:
    obmenux
  from any command line if it's installed.
  
  (Whether or not it is installed, you may run it when the current directory is
  the version folder.)
  
  If your openbox menu for a session isn't named menu.xml, specify the file:
    obmenux .config/openbox/session-menu-name.xml
  
Pipemenu use:
  
  To make an automatically filled menu choose "Add" click on "Pipemenu" and
  enter the parameters for four different kinds of piped menus, as follows:

  obmx-dir <directory> <application to open files in the directory>

  obmx-nav <starting directory for menu> <file manager> <terminal emulator>

  obmx-moz -b <bookmarks file> -n <web browser>

  obmx-xdg <Gnome .menu format file>
      (If your system has any .menu files, they may be in /etc/xdg/menus)

  The paths to files or directories should be written relative to your home
  directory or starting with "/" for root.
  
  If you get any errors or empty menus, try running those commands in a
  terminal to see whether they produce much <XML> as they should, or error
  messages.

  There are some additional notes in the included file "pipes-help".

Details about how installation works:

  "sudo" is necessary just because users don't usually have permission to write
  to their system's /usr/local/ which is for locally installed software and not
  for a Linux distribution's standard packages. Although Unix was originally a
  single-user system, where it might be expected that a user would have such
  permission, Linux is not Unix, and provides multi-user security instead.

  According to how Python "distutils" works on your system, the installer may
  write the following files:

    ./build                   -- the build directory in the same folder

    /usr/local/bin/obmenux    -- allows running obmenux from any directory

    /usr/local/lib/python[version]/dist-packages/obxmlx.py
                              -- a library file for code shared by all the
                                 commands installed

    /usr/local/lib/python[version]/dist-packages/obmenux[version].egg-info
                              -- some library management that may differ on
                                 different systems

  and, if the pipe menus are installed:
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-dir   -- makes a menu from the files in a directory
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-nav   -- makes a menu to navigate directories
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-moz   -- makes a menu from a bookmarks.html file
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-xdg   -- makes a menu from a Gnome .menu file

  The installation should allow continuing to use other versions of obmenu that
  are not named obmenux. If obmenux has errors or causes any interference with
  any other program, that would be an issue to report.
  
CHANGELOG:

- 1.1.25 tested pipemenus with patches and better instructions.

- 1.1.24 precise versioning.

- 1.1.1 moves items between menus (or into or out of menus, including
  moving menus into or out of menus) (deprecated use with Python 2.3 to 2.6)

- Version 1.0-2 has Debian patches to the specific file named obmenu
    - enabled closing the help window by its "Close" button
    - enabled creating .config/openbox/menu.xml if it doesn't already exist.

- Automatically reconfigures Openbox when saving a file.

- Creates and modifies pipemenus. Pipemenus are a way of creating menus
  dynamically. For more info, visit Openbox documentation. (http://openbox.org)

- Creates "link" menus, which are references to other menus by their IDs.
  That way you can reproduce a sub-menu in several places in a whole menu file.

- Lots of GUI enhancements.

- Multifile support (New, Open, Save, Save As)
