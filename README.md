# obmenux : the Openbox Menu Editor X version
an experimental version of obmenu Openbox menu editors

The point of it is to add the additional feature of moving items and menus freely between menus, and maybe other features, and to combine that with bugfixes from other versions of obmenu. So this version will be available here for downloading as an alternative to downloading another obmenu version and applying patches manually for each time a functioning version of obmenu is wanted when setting up a desktop that uses Openbox. (Openbox can be used as a desktop environment by itself or as the window manager for LXDE or Lubuntu.)

The main folder obmenux-[version number] is what to download to use this experimental version of obmenu. Other related and relevant files, such as this README will be outside that folder.

## about versions and forks of obmenu in general:

The original seems out-of-date, not having been changed significantly since it was written in 2005 to 2006, despite numerous patches by distros and forks of it suggesting changes. Changes to the Openbox standards have also made the original version incapable of editing some otherwise valid Openbox menus without rewriting them and destroying much of their valid contents.

There are several sources of patches of obmenu and versions of obmenu by others, such as:
- obmenu-1.0-2+nmu2 in the Debian and Ubuntu repositories
- obmenu2
- obmenu3 which is written in Pascal and compiled with its Pascal dependencies
- obmenu [untitled version] by GLolol, 2015

This current obmenux started with just copying files and editing them to see what would happen. So it doesn't have an automatic GitHub connection as a fork of any other version. It's a messy version that needs some of its experimental code cleaned up before it would be suitable for packaging in a distribution's official repository.
